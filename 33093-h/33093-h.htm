light may so light some other, to espie and marke my faultes,
I&nbsp;wish it may so lighten thẽ, that they may voide offence. Of
staggeringe and stomblinge, and vnconstaunt turmoilinge: often
offending, and seldome amending, such vices to eschewe, and their fine
wittes to shew that they may winne the praise, and I to hold the candle,
whilest they their glorious works with eloquence sette forth, so
cunningly inuented, so finely indited, that my bokes maie seme worthie
to occupie no roome. For neither is mi wit so finelie filed, nother mi
learning so largly lettred, nother yet mi laiser so quiet and vncõbered,

this light haue I kindeled: that learned men maie se, to practise their
pennes, their eloquence to aduaunce, to register their names in the
booke of memorie I drew the platte rudelie, whereon thei maie builde,
whom god hath indued with learning and liuelihod. For liuing by laboure
doth learning so hinder, that learning serueth liuinge, whiche is a
peruers trade. Yet as carefull familie shall cease hir cruell callinge,

t is not vnknowen to youre maiestie, moste soueraigne lorde, what great
disceptacion hath been amongest the wyttie men of all nacions, for the
exacte knoweledge of true felicitie, bothe what it is, and wherein it
consisteth: touchynge whiche thyng, their opinions almoste were as many
in numbre, as were the persons of them, that either disputed or wrote
thereof. But and if the diuersitie of opinions in the vulgar sort for
placyng of their felicitie shall be considered also, the varietie shall
be found so great, and the opinions so dissonant, yea plainly
monsterouse, that no honest witte would vouchesafe to lose time in
hearyng thẽ, or rather (as I may saie) no witte is of so exact
remembrance, that can consider together the monsterouse multitude of
them all. And yet not withstãdyng this repugnant diuersitie, in two
thynges do they all agree. First all do agre, that felicitie is and
ought to be the stop and end of all their doynges, so that he that hath
a full desire to any thyng how so euer it be estemed of other mẽ, yet he
estemeth him self happie, if he maie obtain it: and contrary waies
vnhappie if he can not attaine it. And therfore do all men put their
whole studie to gette that thyng, wherin they haue perswaded them self
that felicitie
<span class = "folionum">[§.iii.<i>v</i>]</span>
<a name = "png006a" id = "png006a"> </a>
<!-- png 006a -->
doth consist. Wherfore some whiche put their felicitie in fedyng their
bellies, thinke no pain to be hard, nor no dede to be vnhonest, that may
be a meanes to fill that foule panche. Other which put their felicitie
in play and ydle pastimes, iudge no time euill spent, that is employed
thereabout: nor no fraude vnlawfull that may further their winning. If I
should particularly ouerrũne but the common sortes of men, which put
their felicitie in their desires, it wold make a great boke of it self.
Therfore wyl I let them al go, and conclude as I <ins class = "notation"
title = "shown as printed">began, That</ins> all men employ their whole
endeuour to that thing, wherin thei thinke felicitie to <ins class =
"notation" title = "printed as shown">stand. whiche</ins> thyng who so
listeth to mark exactly, shall be able to espie and iudge the natures of
al men, whose conuersaciõ he doth know, though thei vse great
dissimulacion to colour their desires, especially whẽ they perceiue
other men to mislyke that which thei so much desire: For no mã wold
gladly haue his appetite improued. And herof cõmeth that secõnde<ins
class = "notation" title = "text has . between words"> </ins>thing
wherin al agree, that euery man would most gladly win all other men to
his sect, and to make thẽ of his opinion, and as far as he dare, will
dispraise all other mens iudgemẽtes, and praise his own waies only,
onles it be when he dissimuleth, and that for the furtherãce of his own
purpose. And this propertie also doth geue great light to the full
knowledge of mens natures, which as all men ought to obserue, so princes
aboue other haue most cause to mark for sundrie occasions which may lye
them on, wherof I shall not nede to speke any farther, consideryng not
only the greatnes of wit, and exactnes of iudgement whiche god hath lent
vnto your highnes person, but also y<sup>e</sup> most graue wisdom and
profoũd knowledge of your maiesties most honorable coũcel, by whõ your
highnes may so sufficiently vnderstãd all thinges conuenient, that lesse
shal it nede to vnderstand by priuate readying, but yet not vtterly to
refuse to read as often as occasion may serue, for bokes dare speake,
when men feare to displease. But to
<span class = "folionum">[§.iiii.]</span>
<a name = "png006b" id = "png006b"> </a>
<!-- png 006b -->
returne agayne to my firste matter, if none other good thing maie be
lerned at their maners, which so wrõgfully place their felicity, in so
miserable a cõditiõ (that while they thinke them selfes happy, their
felicitie must nedes seme vnluckie, to be by them so euill placed) yet
this may men learn at them, by those .ij. spectacles to espye the
secrete natures and dispositions of others, whiche thyng vnto a wise man
is muche auailable. And thus will I omit this great tablement of
vnhappie hap, and wil come to .iij. other sortes of a better degre,
wherof the one putteth felicitie to consist in power and royaltie. The
second sorte vnto power annexeth worldly wisdome, thinkyng him full
happie, that could attayn those two, wherby he might not onely haue
knowledge in all thynges, but also power to bryng his desires to ende.
The thyrd sort estemeth true felicitie to consist in wysdom annexed with
vertuouse maners, thinkyng that they can take harme of nothyng, if they
can with their <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘rwysedome’">wysedome</ins><a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id = "tag1"

been a great numbre in all ages, yea many mightie kinges and great
gouernoures which cared not greately howe they myght atchieue their

for gouernance, then to kepe the people in onely feare of them, <ins

next to his owne, so that he said: If I were not Alexander, I&nbsp;wolde
wishe to be Diogenes. Whereby apeareth, how he esteemed learning, and
what felicity he putte therin, reputing al the worlde saue him selfe to
be inferiour to Diogenes. And bi al coniecturs, Alexander did esteme
Diogenes one of them whiche contemned the vaine estimation of the
disceitfull world, and put his whole felicity in knowledg of vertue, and
practise of the same, though some reporte

that he knew more vertue then he folowed: But whatso euer he was, it
appeareth that Socrates and Plato and many other did forsake their
liuings and sel away their patrimony, to the intent to seeke and
trauaile for learning, which examples I shall not need to repete to your
Maiesty, partly for that your highnes doth often reade them and other
lyke, and partly sith your maiesty hath at hand such learned
schoolemaysters, which can much better thẽ I, declare them vnto your
highnes, and that more largely also then the shortenes of thys epistle
will permit. But thys may I yet adde, that King Salomon whose renoume
spred so farre abroad, was very greatlye estemed for his wonderfull
power and exceading treasure, but yet much more was he estemed for his
wisdom<ins class = "notation" title = ". missing">. </ins>And him selfe
doth bear witnes, that wisedom is better then pretious <ins class =
"notation" title = "printed as shown">stones . yea</ins> all thinges
that can be desired ar not to be compared to it. But what needeth to
alledge one sentence of him, whose bookes altogither do none other
thing, then set forth the praise of wisedom &amp; knowledg? And his
father king <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘Danid’">Dauid</ins> ioyneth <ins class = "notation" title = "anomalous ‘u’ in original">uertuous</ins> conuersacion and knowledg togither, as
the summe of perfection and chief felicity. Wherfore I maye iustelye
conclude, that true felicity doth consist in wisdome and vertu. Then if
wisdome be as Cicero defineth it, <em>Diuinarum atq; humanarum rerum
scientia</em>, then ought all men to trauail for knowledg in matters
both of religion and humaine docrine, if he shall be counted wyse, and
able to attaine true felicitie: But as the study of religious matters is
most principall, so I leue it for this time to them that better can
write of it then I can. And for humaine knowledge thys wil I boldly say,
that who soeuer wyll attain true iudgment therein, must not only trauail
in y<sup>e</sup> knowledg of the tungs, but must also before al other
arts, taste of the mathematical sciences, specially Arithmetike and
Geometry, without which it is not possible to attayn full knowledg in
any art. Which may sufficiẽtly by gathered by Aristotle not õly in his
bookes

of demonstration (whiche can not be vnderstand without Geometry) but
also in all his other workes. And before him Plato his maister wrote
this sentence on his schole house dore. <ins class = "greek" lang = "el"
title = "Ageometrêtos oudeis eisitô">Αγεομέτρητοσ ὀυδὲισ ἐισΐτω.</ins>.
Let no man entre here (saith he) without knowledg in Geometry. Wherfore
moste mighty prince, as your most excellent Maiesty appeareth to be
borne vnto most perfect felicity, not only by reasõ that God moued with
the long prayers of this realme, did send your highnes as moste
comfortable inheritour to the same, but also in that your Maiesty was
borne in the time of such skilful schoolmaisters &amp; learned techers,
as your highnes doth not a little reioyse in, and profite by them in all
kind of vertu &amp; knowledg. Amõgst which is that heauẽly knowledg most
worthely to be praised, wherbi the blindnes of errour &amp; superstition
is exiled, &amp; good hope cõceiued that al the sedes &amp; fruts
therof, with all kindes of vice &amp; iniquite, wherby vertu is
hindered, &amp; iustice defaced, shal be clean <ins class = "correction"

and rooted out of this realm, which hope shal increase more and more, if
it may appear that learning be estemed &amp; florish within this realm.
And al be it the chief learnĩg be the diuine scriptures, which instruct
the mind principally, &amp; nexte therto the lawes politike, which most
specially defẽd the right of goodes, yet is it not possible that those
two can long be wel vsed, if that ayde want that gouerneth health and
expelleth sicknes, which thing is done by Physik, &amp; these require
the help of the vij. liberall sciences, but of none more then of
Arithmetik and Geometry, by which not only great thinges ar wrought

selues more and more dayly bounden to your highnes, if when they shall
perceaue your graces desyre to haue theym profited in all knowledge and
vertue. And I for my poore ability considering your Maiesties studye for
the increase of learning generally through all your highenes dominions,
and namely in the vniuersities of Oxforde and Camebridge, as I haue an
earnest good will as far as my simple seruice and small knowledg will
suffice, to helpe toward the satisfiyng of your graces desire, so if I
shall perceaue that my seruice may be to your maiesties contẽtacion,
I&nbsp;wil not only put forth the other two books, whiche shoulde haue
beene sette forth with these two, yf misfortune had not hindered it, but
also I wil set forth other bookes of more exacter arte, bothe in the
Latine tongue and also in the Englyshe, whereof parte bee all readye
written, and newe instrumentes to theym deuised, and the residue shall
bee eanded with all possible speede. I&nbsp;was boldened to dedicate
this booke of Geometrye vnto your Maiestye, not so muche bycause it is
the firste that euer was sette forthe in Englishe, and therefore for the
noueltye a straunge presente, but for that I was perswaded, that suche a

Eometrye may thinke it selfe to sustaine great iniury, if it shall be
inforced other to show her manifold commodities, or els not to prease
into the sight of men, and therefore might this wayes answere briefely:
Other I am able to do you much good, or els but litle. If I bee able to
doo you much good, then be you not your owne friendes, but greatlye your
owne enemies to make so little of me, which maye profite you so muche.
For if I were as vncurteous as you vnkind, I&nbsp;shuld vtterly refuse
to do them any good, which will so curiously put me to the trial and
profe of my commodities, or els to suffre exile, and namely sithe I shal
only yeld benefites to other, and receaue none againe. But and if you
could saye truely, that my benefites be nother many nor yet greate, yet
if they bee anye, I&nbsp;doo yelde more to you, then I doo receaue
againe of you, and therefore I oughte not to bee repelled of them that
loue them selfe, althoughe they loue me not all for my selfe. But as I
am in nature a liberall science, so canne I not againste nature contende
with your inhumanitye, but muste shewe my selfe liberall euen to myne
enemies. Yet this is my comforte againe, that I haue none enemies but
them that knowe me not, and therefore may hurte themselues, but can not
noye me. Yf they dispraise the thinge that they know not, all wise men
will blame them and not credite them, and yf they thinke they knowe me,
lette theym shewe one vntruthe and erroure in me, and I wyll geue the
victorye.</p>

<p>Yet <!-- no indent --> can no humayne science saie thus, but I onely,
that there is no sparke of vntruthe in me: but all my doctrine and
workes are without any blemishe of errour that mans reason can discerne.
And nexte vnto me in certaintie are my three systers, Arithmetike,
Musike, and Astronomie, whiche are also so nere knitte in amitee, that
he that loueth the one, can not despise the other, and in especiall
Geometrie, of whiche not only these thre, but all other artes do borow
great ayde, as partly hereafter shall be shewed. But first will I
beginne with the vnlearned sorte, that you maie perceiue how that no
arte can stand without me. For if I should declare how many wayes my
helpe is vsed, in measuryng of ground, for medow, corne, and wodde: in
hedgyng, in dichyng, and in stackes makyng, I&nbsp;thinke the poore
Husband man would be more thankefull vnto me, then he is nowe, whyles he
thinketh that he hath small benefite by me. Yet this maie he coniecture
certainly, that if he kepe not the rules of Geometrie, he can not
measure any ground truely. And in dichyng, if he kepe not a proportion
of bredth in the mouthe, to the bredthe of the bottome, and iuste
slopenesse in the sides agreable to them bothe, the diche shall be
faultie many waies. When he doth make stackes for corne, or for heye, he
practiseth good Geometrie, els would thei not long stand: So that in
some stakes, whiche stand on foure pillers, and yet made round, doe
increase greatter and greatter a good height, and then againe turne
smaller and smaller vnto the toppe: you maie see so good Geometrie, that
it were very difficult to counterfaite the lyke in any kynde of
buildyng. As for other infinite waies that he vseth my benefite,
I&nbsp;ouerpasse for shortnesse.</p>

<p>Carpenters, Karuers, Ioyners, and Masons, doe willingly acknowledge
that they can worke nothyng without reason of Geometrie, in so muche
that they chalenge me as a peculiare science for them. But in that they
should do wrong to all other men, seyng euerie kynde of men haue som
benefit by me, not only in buildyng, whiche is but other mennes costes,

<p>But now to procede with learned professions, in Logike and Rhetorike
and all partes of phylosophy, there neadeth none other proofe then
Aristotle his testimony, whiche without Geometry proueth almost
nothinge. In Logike all his good syllogismes and demonstrations, hee
declareth by the principles of Geometrye. In philosophye, nether motion,
nor time, nor ayrye impressions could hee aptely declare, but by the
helpe of Geometrye as his woorkes do witnes. Yea the faculties of the
minde dothe hee expresse by similitude to figures of Geometrye. And in
morall phylosophy he thought that iustice coulde not wel be taught, nor
yet well executed without proportion geometricall. And this estimacion
of Geometry he maye seeme to haue learned of his maister Plato, which
without Geometrye wolde teache nothinge, nother wold admitte any to
heare him, except he were experte in Geometry. And what merualle if he
so muche estemed geometrye, seinge his opinion was, that Godde was <ins
class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘alwaaies’">alwaies</ins>
workinge
<span class = "folionum">[†].ii.</span>
<a name = "png017b" id = "png017b"> </a>
<!-- png 017b -->
by Geometrie? Whiche sentence Plutarche declareth at large. And although
Platto do vse the helpe of Geometrye in all the most waighte matter of a
common wealth, yet it is so generall in vse, that no small thinges
almost can be wel done without it. And therfore saith he: that Geometrye
is to be learned, if it were for none other cause, but that all other
artes are bothe soner and more surely vnderstand by helpe of it.</p>

<p>What greate help it dothe in physike, Galene doth so often and so
copiousely declare, that no man whiche hath redde any booke almoste of
his, can be ignorant thereof<ins class = "notation" title = "text has . for ,">, </ins>in so much that he coulde neuer cure well a rounde
vlcere, tyll reason geometricall dydde teache it hym. Hippocrates is
earnest in admonyshynge that study of geometrie must prepare the way to
physike, as well as to all other artes.</p>

<p>I shoulde seeme somewhat to tedious, if I shoulde recken vp, howe the
diuines also in all their mysteries of scripture doo vse healpe of
geometrie: and also that lawyers can neuer vnderstande the hole lawe, no
nor yet the firste title therof exactly without Geometrie. For if lawes
can not well be established, nor iustice duelie executed without
geometricall proportion, as bothe Plato in his Politike bokes, and
Aristotle in his Moralles doo largely declare. Yea sithe Lycurgus that
cheefe lawmaker amongest the Lacedemonians, is moste praised for that he
didde chaunge the state of their common wealthe frome the proportion
Arithmeticall to a proportion geometricall, whiche without knowledg of
bothe he coulde not dooe, than is it easye to perceaue howe necessarie
Geometrie is for the lawe and studentes thereof. And if I shall saie
preciselie and freelie as I thinke, he is vtterlie destitute of all
abilitee to iudge in anie arte, that is not sommewhat experte in the
Theoremes of Geometrie.</p>

<p>And <!-- no indent --> that caused Galene to say of hym selfe, that
he coulde neuer perceaue what a demonstration was, no not so muche, as
whether there were any or none, tyll he had by geometrie gotten abilitee
to vnderstande it, although he heard the beste teachers that were in his
tyme. It shuld be to longe and nedelesse
<span class = "folionum">[†.ii.<i>v</i>]</span>
<a name = "png018" id = "png018"> </a>
<!-- png 018 -->
also to declare what helpe all other artes Mathematicall haue by
geometrie, sith it is the grounde of all theyr certeintie, and no man
studious in them is so doubtful therof, that he shall nede any
persuasion to procure credite thereto. For he can not reade .ij. lines
almoste in any mathematicall science, but he shall espie the nedefulnes
of geometrie. But to auoyde tediousnesse I will make an ende hereof with
that famous sentence of auncient Pythagoras, That who so will trauayle
by learnyng to attayne wysedome, shall neuer approche to any excellencie
without the artes mathematicall, and especially Arithmetike and
Geometrie.</p>

<p>And yf I shall somewhat speake of noble men, and gouernours of
realmes, howe needefull Geometrye maye bee vnto them, then must I repete
all that I haue sayde before, sithe in them ought all knowledge to
abounde, namely that maye appertaine either to good gouernaunce in time
of peace, eyther wittye pollicies in time of warre. For ministration of
good lawes in time of peace Lycurgus example with the testimonies of
Plato and Aristotle may suffise. And as for warres, I&nbsp;might thinke
it sufficient that Vegetius hath written, and after him Valturius in
commendation of Geometry, for vse of warres, but all their woordes seeme
to saye nothinge, in comparison to the example of Archimedes worthy
woorkes make by geometrie, for the defence of his countrey, to reade the
wonderfull praise of his wittie deuises, set foorthe by the most famous
hystories of Liuius, Plutarche, and Plinie, and all other
hystoriographiers, whyche wryte of the stronge siege of
<em>Syracusæ</em> made by that valiant capitayne, and noble warriour
<em>Marcellus</em>, whose power was so great, that all men meruayled how
that one citee coulde withstande his wonderfull force so longe. But much
more woulde they meruaile, if they vnderstode that one man onely dyd
withstand all Marcellus strength, and with counter engines destroied his
engines to the vtter astonyshment of <em>Marcellus</em>, and all that
were with hym. He had inuented suche balastelas that dyd shoote out a
hundred dartes at one
<span class = "folionum">†.iij.</span>
<a name = "png019" id = "png019"> </a>
<!-- png 019 -->
shotte, to the great destruction of <em>Marcellus</em> souldiours,
wherby a fonde tale was spredde abrode, how that in Syracusæ there was a
wonderfull gyant, whiche had a hundred handes, and coulde shoote a
hundred dartes at ones. And as this fable was spredde of Archimedes, so
many other haue been fayned to bee gyantes and monsters, bycause they
dyd suche thynges, whiche farre passed the witte of the common people.
So dyd they feyne Argus to haue a hundred eies, bicause they herde of
his wonderfull circumspection, and thoughte that as it was aboue their
capacitee, so it could not be, onlesse he had a hundred eies. So
imagined they Ianus to haue two faces, one lokyng forwarde, and an other
backwarde, bycause he coulde so wittily compare thynges paste with
thynges that were to come, and so duely pondre them, as yf they were all
present. Of like reasõ did they feyn Lynceus to haue such sharp syght,
that he could see through walles and hylles, bycause peraduenture he dyd
by naturall iudgement declare what cõmoditees myght be digged out of the
grounde. And an infinite noumbre lyke fables are there, whiche sprange
all of lyke reason.</p>

<p>For what other thyng meaneth the fable of the great gyant Atlas,
whiche was ymagined to beare vp heauen on his shulders? but that he was
a man of so high a witte, that it reached vnto the skye, and was so
skylfull in Astronomie, and coulde tell before hande of Eclipses, and
other like thynges as truely as though he dyd rule the sterres, and
gouerne the planettes.</p>

<p>So was Eolus accompted god of the wyndes, and to haue theim all in a
caue at his pleasure, by reason that he was a wittie man in naturall
knowlege, and obserued well the change of wethers, aud was the fyrst
that taught the obseruation of the wyndes. And lyke reson is to be geuen
of al the old fables.</p>

<p>But to retourne agayne to Archimedes, he dyd also by arte perspectiue
(whiche is a parte of geometrie) deuise such glasses within the towne of
Syracusæ, that dyd bourne their ennemies shyppes a great way from the
towne, whyche was a meruaylous politike thynge. And if I shulde repete

varietees of suche straunge inuentions, as Archimedes and others haue
wrought by geometrie, I&nbsp;should not onely excede the order of a
preface, but I should also speake of suche thynges as can not well be
vnderstande in talke, without somme knowledge in the principles of
geometrie.</p>

<p>But this will I promyse, that if I may perceaue my paynes to be
thankfully taken, I&nbsp;wyll not onely write of suche pleasant
inuentions, declaryng what they were, but also wil teache howe a great
numbre of them were wroughte, that they may be practised in this tyme
also. Wherby shallbe plainly perceaued, that many thynges seme
impossible to be done, whiche by arte may very well be wrought. And whan
they be wrought, and the reason therof not vnderstande, than say the
vulgare people, that those thynges are done by <ins class = "notation"
title = "spelling unchanged">negromancy</ins>. And hereof came it that
fryer Bakon was accompted so greate a <ins class = "notation" title =
"spelling unchanged">negromancier</ins>, whiche neuer vsed that arte (by
any coniecture that I can fynde) but was in geometrie and other
mathematicall sciences so experte, that he coulde dooe by theim suche
thynges as were wonderfull in the syght of most people.</p>

<p>Great talke there is of a glasse that he made in Oxforde, in whiche
men myght see thynges that were doon in other places, and that was
iudged to be done by power of euyll spirites. But I knowe the reason of
it to bee good and naturall, and to be wrought by geometrie (sythe
perspectiue is a parte of it) and to stande as well with reason as to
see your face in cõmon glasse. But this conclusion and other dyuers of
lyke sorte, are more mete for princes, for sundry causes, than for other
men, and ought not to bee taught commonly. Yet to repete it,
I&nbsp;thought good for this cause, that the worthynes of geometry myght
the better be knowen, &amp; partly vnderstanding geuen, what wonderfull
thynges may be wrought by it, and so consequently how pleasant it is,
and how necessary also.</p>

<p>And thus for this tyme I make an end. The reason of som thynges done
in this boke, or omitted in the same, you shall fynde in the preface
before the Theoremes.<a class = "tag" name = "tag2" id = "tag2" href =

A poincte.</span>
<em>A Poynt or a Prycke</em>, is named of Geometricians that small and
vnsensible shape, whiche hath in it no partes, that is to say: nother
length, breadth nor depth. But as their exactnes of definition is more
meeter for onlye Theorike speculacion, then for practise and outwarde
worke (consideringe that myne intent is to applye all these whole
principles to woorke) I&nbsp;thynke meeter for this purpose, to call a
<em>poynt or prycke</em>, that small printe of penne, pencyle, or other
instrumente, whiche is not moued, nor drawen from his fyrst touche, and
therfore hath no notable length nor bredthe: as this example doeth

<p>Where I haue set .iij. prickes, eche of them hauyng both lẽgth and

<p>Nowe of a great numbre of these prickes, is made a <em>Lyne</em>, as

<p>Of lynes there bee two principall kyndes. The one is called a right

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A streghte lyne.</span>
<em>A Straight lyne</em>, is the shortest that maye be drawenne between

<p><span class = "sidenote">

And all other lines, that go not right forth from prick to prick, but
boweth any waye<ins class = "notation" title = "text has . for ,">,
</ins>such are called <em>Croked lynes</em> as in these examples
folowyng ye may se, where I haue set but one forme of a straight lyne,
for more formes there be not, but of crooked lynes there bee innumerable
diuersities, whereof for examples sum I haue sette here.</p>

<p>So now you must vnderstand, that <em>euery lyne is drawen betwene
twoo prickes</em>, wherof the one is at the beginning, and the other at
the ende.</p>

<p class = "floatright">
<img src = "images/pic022e.png" width = "91" height = "71"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>Therefore when soeuer you do see any formes of lynes to touche at one
notable pricke, as in this example, then shall you
<span class = "folionum">A ij</span>
<a name = "png023" id = "png023"> </a>
<!-- png 023 -->
not call it one <ins class = "notation" title = "text reads ‘cr oked’">croked</ins> lyne, but rather twoo lynes:
<span class = "sidenote">
an Angle.</span>
in as muche as there is a notable and sensible angle by <em>.A.</em>
whiche euermore is made by the meetyng of two seuerall lynes. And
likewayes shall you iudge of this figure, whiche is made of two lines,
and not of one onely.</p>

<p class = "floatright">
<img src = "images/pic023a.png" width = "87" height = "47"
alt = "see text"></p>

<p>So that whan so euer any suche meetyng of lines doth happen, the
place of their metyng is called an <em>Angle or corner</em>.</p>

<p>Of angles there be three generall kindes: a sharpe angle, a square
angle, and a blunte angle.
<span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;righte angle.</span>
<em>The square angle</em>, whiche is commonly named <em>a&nbsp;right
corner</em>, is made of twoo lynes meetyng together in fourme of a
squire, whiche two lines, if they be drawen forth in length, will crosse
one an other: as in the examples folowyng you maie see.</p>

<p class = "floatright">
Right angles.<br>
<img src = "images/pic023b.png" width = "179" height = "85"
alt = "see caption and text"></p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A sharpe corner.</span>
<em>A sharpe angle</em> is so called, because it is lesser than is a
square angle, and the lines that make it, do not open so wide in their
departynge as in a square corner, and if thei be drawen crosse, all
fower corners will not be equall.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A blunte angle.</span>
<em>A blunt or brode corner</em>, is greater then is a square angle, and
his lines do parte more in sonder then in a right angle, of whiche all
take these examples.</p>

<p class = "space">
And these angles (as you see) are made partly of streght lynes, partly
of croken lines, and partly of both together. Howbeit in right angles I
haue put none example of croked lines, because it would
<span class = "folionum">[A.ii.<i>v</i>]</span>
<a name = "png024" id = "png024"> </a>

muche trouble a lerner to iudge them: for their true iudgment doth
appertaine to arte perspectiue, and as I may say, rather to reason then
to sense.</p>

<p>But now as of many prickes there is made one line, so <em>of diuerse
lines are there made sundry formes, figures, and shapes</em>, whiche all
yet be called by one propre name,
<span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;platte forme.</span>
<em>Platte formes</em>, and thei haue bothe <em>length and bredth, but
yet no depenesse</em>.</p>

<p>And <em>the boundes</em> of euerie platte forme are lines: as by the
examples you maie perceiue.</p>

<p>Of platte formes some be plain, and some be croked, and some parly
plaine, and partlie croked.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A plaine platte.</span>
<em>A plaine platte</em> is that, whiche is made al equall in height, so
that the middle partes nother bulke vp, nother shrink down more then the
bothe endes.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A crooked platte.</span>
For whan the one parte is higher then the other, then is it named a
<em>Croked platte</em>.</p>

<p>And if it be partlie plaine, and partlie crooked, then is it called a
<em>Myxte platte</em>, of all whiche, these are exaumples.</p>

<p>And as of many prickes is made a line, and of diuerse lines one
platte forme,
<span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;bodie.</span>
so of manie plattes is made <em>a&nbsp;bodie</em>, whiche conteigneth
<em>Lengthe, bredth, and depenesse</em>.
<span class = "sidenote">
Depenesse.</span>
By <em>Depenesse</em> I vnderstand, not as the common sort doth, the
holownesse of any thing, as of a well, a&nbsp;diche, a&nbsp;potte, and
suche like, but I meane the massie thicknesse
<span class = "folionum">A iii</span>
<a name = "png025" id = "png025"> </a>
<!-- png 025 -->
of any bodie, as in exaumple of a potte: the depenesse is after the
common name, the space from his brimme to his bottome. But as I take it
here, the depenesse of his bodie is his thicknesse in the sides, whiche
is an other thyng cleane different from the depenesse of his holownes,
that the common people meaneth.</p>

<p>Now all bodies haue platte formes for their boundes,
<span class = "sidenote">
Cubike.</span>
so in a dye (whiche is called <em>a&nbsp;cubike bodie</em>) by
geomatricians,
<span class = "sidenote">
Asheler.</span>
and an <em>ashler</em> of masons, there are .vi. sides, whiche are .vi.
platte formes, and are the boundes of the dye.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
A globe.</span>
But in a <em>Globe</em>, (whiche is a bodie rounde as a bowle) there is
but one platte forme, and one bounde, and these are the exaumples of
them bothe.</p>

<p>But because you shall not muse what I dooe call
<em>a&nbsp;bound</em>,
<span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;bounde.</span>
I&nbsp;mean therby a generall name, betokening the beginning, end and
side, of any forme.</p>

<p><span class = "sidenote">
Forme, Fygure.</span>
<em>A forme, figure, or shape</em>, is that thyng that is inclosed
within one bond or manie bondes, so that you vnderstand that shape, that
the eye doth discerne, and not the substance of the bodie.</p>

<p>Of <em>figures</em> there be manie sortes, for either thei be made of
prickes, lines, or platte formes. Not withstandyng to speake properlie,
<em>a&nbsp;figure</em> is euer made by platte formes, and not of bare
lines vnclosed, neither yet of prickes.</p>

<p>Yet for the lighter forme of teachyng, it shall not be vnsemely to
call all suche shapes, formes and figures, whiche y<sup>e</sup> eye maie
discerne distinctly.</p>

<p>And first to begin with prickes, there maie be made diuerse formes of
them, as partely here doeth folowe.</p>

<p>And so maie there be infinite formes more, whiche I omitte for this
time, cõsidering that their knowledg appertaineth more to Arithmetike
figurall, than to Geometrie.</p>

<p>But yet one name of a pricke, whiche he taketh rather of his place
then of his fourme, maie I not ouerpasse. And that is, when a pricke
standeth in the middell of a circle (as no circle can be made by cõpasse
without it) then is it called <em>a&nbsp;centre</em>.
<span class = "sidenote">
A&nbsp;centre</span>
And thereof doe masons, and other worke menne call that patron,
a&nbsp;<em>centre</em>, whereby thei drawe the lines, for iust hewyng of
stones for arches, vaultes, and chimneies, because the chefe vse of that
patron is wrought by findyng that pricke or centre, from whiche all the

they haue no syde equall to an other as these examples shew, neither
keepe they any rate in their corners, and therfore are they counted
<em>vnruled formes</em>, and the other foure kindes onely are counted
<em>ruled formes</em>, in the kynde of quadrangles. Of these vnruled
formes ther is no numbre, they are so mannye and so dyuers, yet by arte
they may be changed into other kindes of figures, and therby be brought
to measure and proportion, as in the thirtene conclusion is partly

<p>Likewyse shall you iudge of <em>siseangles</em>, which haue sixe

for as mannye numbres as there maye be of sydes and angles, so manye
diuers kindes be there of figures, vnto which yow shall geue names

and wyll sette forthe on example of a syseangle, whiche I had almost

bicause that without perspectiue knowledge, it is not easy to iudge

nere the eand of your line, that you can not extende any notable length

drawe your line lenger frõ that end, then doth this conclusion require a

shall you dooe thus: If your line be of any notable length, deuide it

notable partes, then make an other line at will, and parte it into fiue
equall portiõs: so that thre of those partes maie be found in your line.
Then open your compas as wide as thre of these fiue measures be, and

the plumme line to lighte (whiche I call the first pricke,) and with the

<p><em>B.C.G,</em> is the triangle appoincted vnto, whiche I muste make
an equall likeiamme. And <em>D,</em> is the angle that the likeiamme
must haue. Therfore first entendyng to erecte the likeiãme on the one
side, that the ground line of the triangle (whiche is <em>B.G.</em>)
I&nbsp;do draw a gemow line by <em>C,</em> and make it parallele to the
ground line <em>B.G,</em> and that new gemow line is <em>A.H.</em> Then
do I raise a line from <em>B.</em> vnto the gemowe line, (whiche line is
<em>A.B</em>) and make an angle equall to <em>D,</em> that is the
appointed angle (accordyng as the .viij. cõclusion teacheth<ins class =

to the first gemowe line (<em>A.H.</em>) an other line that is parallele

also that it hath one angle (that is <ins class = "correction" title =

the angle that was limitted. And so haue I mine intent. The profe of the
equalnes of those two figures doeth depend of the .xli. proposition of
Euclides first boke, and is the .xxxi. proposition of this second boke
of Theoremis, whiche saieth, that whan a tryangle and a likeiamme be
made betwene .ij. selfe same gemow lines, and haue their ground line of
one length, then is the likeiamme double to the triangle, wherof it
foloweth, that if .ij. suche figures so drawen differ in their ground

ground line of the triangle, then be those .ij. figures equall, as you

<p>In these .ij. last figures <em>E.</em> and <em>F,</em> the circle is
not named to be drawen in a triangle, because it doth not touche the
sides of the triangle, neither is the triangle coũted to be drawen in
the circle, because one of his corners doth not touche the circumference
of the circle, yet (as you see) the circle is within the triangle, and
the triangle within the circle, but nother of them is properly named to
be in the other. Now to come to the conclusion. If the triangle haue all
.iij. sides lyke, then shall you take the middle of euery side, and from
the contrary corner drawe a right line vnto that poynte, and where those
lines do crosse one an other, there is the centre. Then set one foote of
the compas in the centre and stretche out the other to the middle pricke
of any of the sides, and so drawe a compas, whiche shall touche euery
side of the triangle, but shall not passe with out any of them.</p>

<h4>Example.</h4>

<p class = "floatleft">

<ins class = "correction" title = "error for ‘in’?"><em>M.</em></ins>&nbsp;<em>G,</em>) I&nbsp;set the one foote of
my compasse, because it is the common centre, and so drawe a circle
accordyng to the distaunce of any of the sides of the triangle. And then
find I that circle to agree iustely to all the sides of the triangle, so
that the circle is iustely made in the triangle, as the conclusion did
purporte. And this is euer true, when the triangle hath all thre sides
equall, other at the least .ij. sides lyke long. But in the other kindes
of triangles you must deuide euery angle in the middle, as the third
conclusion teaches you.

And so drawe lines frõ eche angle to their middle pricke. And where
those lines do crosse, there is the common centre, from which you shall
draw a perpendicular to one of the sides. Then sette one foote of the
compas in that centre, and stretche the other foote accordyng to the

Doubt not gentle reader, but as my argument is straunge and vnacquainted
with the vulgare toungue, so shall I of many men be straungly talked of,
and as straungly iudged. Some men will saye peraduenture, I&nbsp;mighte
haue better imployed my tyme in some pleasaunte historye, comprisinge
matter of chiualrye. Some other wolde more haue preised my trauaile, if
I hadde spente the like time in some morall matter, other in <ins class
= "correction" title = "text reads ‘decising’">deciding</ins> some
controuersy of religion. And yet some men (as I iudg) will not mislike
this kind of mater, but then will they wishe that I had vsed a more
certaine order in placinge bothe the Propositions and Theoremes, and
also a more exacter proofe of eche of theim bothe, by demonstrations
mathematicall. Some also will mislike my shortenes and simple plainesse,
as other of other affections diuersely shall espye somwhat that they
shall thinke blame worthy, and shal misse somewhat, that thei wold with
to haue bene here vsed, so that euerie manne shall giue his verdicte of
me according to his phantasie, vnto whome ioinctly, I&nbsp;make this my
firste answere: that as they ar many and in opinions verie diuers, so
were it scarse possible to please them all with anie one argumente, of
what kinde so euer it were. And for my seconde aunswere, I&nbsp;saye
thus. That if annye one argumente mighte please them all, then should
thei be thankfull vnto me for this kind of matter. For nother is there
anie matter more straunge in the englishe tungue, then this whereof
neuer booke was written before now, in that tungue, and therefore oughte
to delite all them, that desire to vnderstand strange matters, as most
men commonlie doo. And againe the practise is so pleasaunt in vsinge,
and so profitable in appliynge, that who so euer dothe
<span class = "folionum">[a.ii.<i>v</i>]</span>
<a name = "png091a" id = "png091a"> </a>
<!-- png 091a -->
delite in anie of bothe, ought not of right to mislike this arte. And if
any manne shall like the arte welle for it selfe, but shall mislyke the
fourme that I haue vsed in teachyng of it, to hym I shall saie, Firste,
that I dooe wishe with hym that some other man, whiche coulde better
haue doone it, hadde shewed his good will, and vsed his diligence in
suche sorte, that I myght haue bene therby occasioned iustely to haue
left of my laboure, or after my trauaile to haue suppressed my bookes.
But sithe no manne hath yet attempted the like, as far as I canne
learne, I&nbsp;truste all suche as bee not exercised in the studie of
Geometrye, shall finde greate ease and furtheraunce by this simple,
plaine, and easie forme of writinge. And shall perceaue the exacte
woorkes of Theon, and others that write on Euclide, a&nbsp;great deale
the <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘somner’">soner</ins>,
by this blunte delineacion afore hande to them taughte. For I dare
presuppose of them, that thing which I haue sette in my selfe, and haue
marked in others, that is to saye, that it is not easie for a man that
shall trauaile in a straunge arte, to vnderstand at the beginninge bothe
the thing that is taught and also the iuste reason whie it is so. And by
experience of teachinge I haue tried it to bee true, for whenne I haue
taughte the proposition, as it is imported in meaninge, and annexed the
demonstration with all, I&nbsp;didde perceaue that it was a greate
trouble and a painefull vexacion of mynde to the learner, to comprehend
bothe those thinges at ones. And therfore did I proue firste to make
them to vnderstande the sence of the propositions, and then afterward
did they conceaue the demonstrations muche soner, when they hadde the
sentence of the propositions first ingrafted in their mindes. This
thinge caused me in bothe these bookes to omitte the demonstrations, and
to vse onlye a plaine forme of declaration, which might best serue for
the firste introduction. Whiche example <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘hat’">hath</ins> beene vsed by other learned menne before
nowe, for not only Georgius Ioachimus Rheticus, but also Boetius that
wittye clarke did set forth some whole books of Euclide, without any
demonstration or any
<span class = "folionum">a.iij.</span>
<a name = "png091" id = "png091"> </a>
<!-- png 091b -->
other declaratiõ at al. But &amp; if I shal hereafter perceaue that it
maie be a thankefull trauaile to sette foorth the propositions of
geometrie with demonstrations, I&nbsp;will not refuse to dooe it, and
that with sundry varietees of demonstrations, bothe pleasaunt and
profitable also. And then will I in like maner prepare to sette foorth
the other bookes, whiche now are lefte vnprinted, by occasion not so
muche of the charges in cuttyng of the figures, as for other iuste
hynderances, whiche I truste hereafter shall bee remedied. In the meane
season if any man muse why I haue sette the Conclusions beefore the
Teoremes, seynge many of the Theoremes seeme to include the cause of
some of the conclusions, and therfore oughte to haue gone before them,
as the cause goeth before the effecte. Here vnto I saie, that although
the cause doo go beefore the effect in order of nature, yet in order of
teachyng the effect must be fyrst declared, and than the cause therof
shewed, for so that men best vnderstãd things First to lerne that such
thinges ar to be wrought, and secondarily what thei ar, and what thei do
import, and thã thirdly what is the cause therof. An other cause why
y<sup>t</sup> the theoremes be put after the cõclusions is this, whã I
wrote these first <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘cũclusions’">cõnclusions</ins> (which was .iiiij. yeres passed)
I&nbsp;thought not then to haue added any theoremes, but next vnto
y<sup>e</sup> cõclusiõs to haue taught the order how to haue applied thẽ
to work, for drawing of plottes &amp; such like vses. But afterward
cõsidering the great cõmoditie y<sup>t</sup> thei serue for, and the
light that thei do geue to all sortes of practise geometricall, besyde
other more notable benefites, whiche shall be declared more specially in
a place conuenient, I&nbsp;thoughte beste to geue you some taste of
theym, and the pleasaunt contemplation of suche geometrical
propositions, which might serue diuerselye in other bookes for the
demonstrations and proofes of all Geometricall woorkes. And in theim, as
well as in the propositions, I&nbsp;haue drawen in the Linearie examples
many tymes more lynes, than be spoken of in the explication of them,
whiche is doone to this intent, that yf any manne lyst to learne the
demonstrations by harte, <ins class = "correction" title = "open parenthesis missing">(as</ins> somme

learned men haue iudged beste to doo) those same men should find the
Linearye exaumples to serue for this purpose, and to wante no thyng
needefull to the iuste proofe, whereby this booke may bee wel approued
to be more complete then many men wolde suppose it.</p>

<p>And thus for this tyme I wyll make an ende without any larger
declaration of the commoditiees of this arte, or any farther answeryng
to that may bee obiected agaynst my handelyng of it, wyllyng them that
myslike it, not to medle with it: and vnto those that will not disdaine
the studie of it, I&nbsp;promise all suche aide as I shall be able to
shewe for their farther procedyng both in the same, and in all other
commoditees that thereof maie ensue. And for their incouragement I haue
here annexed the names and brefe argumentes of suche bookes, as I
intende (God willyng) shortly to sette forth, if I shall perceaue that
my paynes maie profyte other, as my desyre is.</p>

<p>Set for an example <em>A.</em> and <em>B,</em> of which two though
<em>A.</em> seme the greatter angle to some men of small experience, it
happeneth only bicause that the lines aboute <em>A,</em> are longer thẽ
the lines about <em>B,</em> as you may proue by drawing them longer, for
so that <em>B.</em> seme the greater angle yf you make his lines longer
then the lines that make the angle&nbsp;<em>A.</em> And to proue it by
demonstration, I&nbsp;say thus. If any ij. right corners be not equal,
then one right corner is greater then an other, but that corner which
<ins class = "correction" title = "s invisible">is</ins> greatter then a
right angle, is a blunt corner (by his definition) so must one corner be
both a right corner and a blunt corner also, which is not possible: And
againe: the lesser right corner must be a sharpe corner, by his
definition, bicause it is lesse then a right <ins class = "notation"
title = "printed as shown">angle. which</ins> thing is impossible.
Therefore I conclude that all right angles be <ins class = "correction"

<p class = "floatright">
<img src = "images/pic097.png" width = "122" height = "262"

<p>A platte forme, as you harde before, hath bothe length and bredthe,
and is inclosed with lines as with his boundes, but ij. right lines
cannot inclose al the bondes of any platte forme. Take for an example
firste these two right lines <ins class = "notation" title = "text reads ‘A B.’"><em>A.B.</em></ins> and <em>A.C.</em> whiche meete togither in
<em>A,</em> but yet cannot be called a platte forme, bicause there is no
bond from <em>B.</em> to <em>C,</em> but if you will drawe a line
betwene them twoo, that is frome <em>B.</em> to <em>C,</em> then will it
be a platte forme, that is to say, a&nbsp;triangle, but then are there
iij. lines, and not only ij. Likewise may you say of <em>D.E.</em> and
<em>F.G,</em> whiche doo make a platte forme, nother yet can they make
any without helpe of two lines more, whereof the one must be drawen from
<em>D.</em> to <em>F,</em> and the other frome <em>E.</em> to
<em>G,</em> and then will it be a longe rquare. So then of two right
lines can bee made no platte forme. But of ij. croked lines be made a
platte forme, as you se in the eye form. And also of one right line,
&amp; one croked line, maye a platte fourme bee made, as the semicircle
<em>F.</em> doothe sette forth.</p>

<p>Examples therof you may take both in greatnes and also in numbre.
First (though it pertaine not proprely to geometry, but to helpe the
vnderstandinge of the rules, whiche may bee wrought by bothe artes) thus
may you perceaue. If the summe of monnye in my purse, and the mony in
your purse be equall eche of them to the mony that any other man hathe,
then must needes your mony and mine be equall togyther. Likewise, if
anye ij. quantities, as <ins class = "notation" title = ". missing"><em>A.</em></ins> and <em>B,</em> be equal to an other, as vnto
<em>C,</em> then muste nedes <em>A.</em> and <em>B.</em> be equall eche

<span class = "folionum">[b.iiii.<i>v</i>]</span>
<a name = "png102" id = "png102"> </a>
<!-- png 102 -->
it doeth appere that no parte can be so great as the whole circle,
(accordyng to the meanyng of the eight sentence) so yet it is certain,
that all those eight partes together be equall vnto the whole circle.
And this is the meanyng of that common sentence (whiche many vse, and
fewe do rightly vnderstand) that is, that <em>All the partes of any
thing are nothing els, but the whole</em>. And contrary waies: <em>The
whole is nothing els, but all his partes taken</em> <ins class =

<img src = "images/pic102b.png" width = "83" height = "80"

but that that meanyng is false, it doth plainly appere by this figure

nexte vnto it, that is <em>D.E,</em> is the longest amongest the rest.
And contrarie waies, <em>D.B,</em> is the shorteste, because it is

therfore is it shorter then <em>D.E.</em> Now for those partes of the

because</ins> it is the parte of that line which passeth by the <ins

nearer any line is to <em>D.C,</em> (which ioyneth with the diameter)
the shorter it is and the farther of from it, the longer it is. And
seyng two lynes can not be of like distaunce beinge bothe on one side,
therefore if they shal be of one lengthe, and consequently of one
distaunce, they must needes bee on contrary sides of the saide line
<em>D.C.</em> And so appeareth the meaning of the whole Theoreme.</p>

touch the circumference: and the lines that doo inclose that angle,
muste be drawen to the extremities of that line, which maketh the cantle

if the lines that inclose that angle, doo not ende in the extremities of

difference of an angle in a cantle, and an angle of a cantle, first for
an example I take the greter cãtle <em>B.A.D,</em> in which is but one
angle made, and that is the angle by <em>A,</em> which is made of a line
<ins class = "notation" title = "text reads ‘A,B,’"><em>A.B,</em></ins>
and the line <ins class = "notation" title = "printed as shown"><em>A.D,</em> And</ins> this angle is therfore called an angle in

called the angles of that cantle, so the twoo angles made of the righte
line <em>D.B,</em> and the arche line <em>D.A.B,</em> are the twoo
angles of this cantle, whereof the one is by <em>D,</em> and the other
is by&nbsp;<em>B.</em> Wher you must remẽbre, that the ãgle by

<em>A.E.D,</em> which in this case must be omitted as no line. Also the

in the poynte <em>C,</em> and there make an angle, whiche is called an
angle made in that lesser cantle, but yet is not any angle of that
cantle. And so haue you heard the difference betweene an angle in a
cantle, and an angle of a cantle. And <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘n’">in</ins> lyke sorte shall you iudg of the ãgle made in
a semicircle, whiche is distinct frõ the angles of the semicircle. For
in this figure, the angles of the semicircle are those angles which be
by <em>A.</em> and <em>D,</em> and be made of the right line
<em>A.D,</em> beeyng the diameter, and of the halfe circumference of the
circle, but by the angle made in the semicircle is that angle by
<em>B,</em> whiche is made of the righte line <em>A.B,</em> and that
other right line <em>B.D,</em> whiche as they mete in the circumference,
and make an angle, so they ende with their other extremities at the
endes of the diameter. These thynges premised, now saie I touchyng the
Theoreme, that euerye angle that is made in a semicircle, is a right
angle, and if it be made in any cãtle of a circle, thẽ must it neds be
other a blũt ãgle, or els a sharpe angle, and in no wise a righte angle.
For if the cantle wherein the angle is made, be greater then the halfe
circle, then is that angle a sharpe angle. And generally the greater the
cãtle is, the lesser is the angle comprised in that cantle: and contrary
waies, the lesser any cantle is, the greater is the angle that is made
in it. Wherfore it must nedes folowe, that the angle made in a cantle
lesse then a semicircle, must nedes be greater then a right angle. So
the angle by <em>B,</em> beyng made at the right line <em>A.B,</em> and
the righte line <em>B.D,</em> is a iuste righte angle, because it is
made in a semicircle. But the angle made by <em>A,</em> which is made of
the right line <em>A.B,</em> and of the right line <em>A.D,</em> is
lesser then a righte angle, and is named a sharpe angle, for as muche as
it is made in a cantle of a circle, greater then a semicircle. And
contrary waies, the angle by <em>C,</em> beyng made of the righte line
<em>B.C,</em> and of the right line <em>C.D,</em> is greater then a
right angle, and is named a blunte angle, because it is made in a cantle
of a circle, lesser then a semicircle. But now touchyng the other angles
of the cantles, I&nbsp;saie accordyng to the Theoreme, that the .ij<ins

cantle, which are by <em>B.</em> and <em>D,</em> as is before declared,

.ij. cantles, wherof the greater is <em>B.A.D,</em> and the lesser is

is equall to the angle made in the cantle on the other side of the said

<ins class = "notation" title = "text reads ‘B D.F,’"><em>B.D.F,</em></ins> is equall to the angle <em>B.A.D,</em>

<h5>Language and Typography</h5>

<p><i>This information is for readers who know more about geometry than
about mid-16th-century English.</i></p>

<p>The letters <b>u</b> and <b>v</b> follow the conventional “initial v,
non-initial u” pattern except in numbers (xv, iv). The lower-case
<b>j</b> form occurs only as the last digit of a number (ij, xxj);
upper-case <b>I</b> and <b>J</b> share a form, always read as&nbsp;I.
Italic double <b>s</b> was printed as an ſ+s ligature, similar to the
German&nbsp;ß; it is shown as simple “ss”. Capital and lower-case
<b>w</b> were often used interchangeably. Words split across line breaks
may or may not have a hyphen.</p>

<p>The word “other” is used interchangeably with both “or” and “either”;
similarly, “nother” is used in place of “nor” and “neither”. The
expression “an other” is almost always written as two words.</p>

<p>The spellings “then(ne)” and “than(ne)” are used interchangeably;
“than(ne)” is rare. The spelling “liyng”, both by itself and as the end
of a longer word, is used consistently.</p>
